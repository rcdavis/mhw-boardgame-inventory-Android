# Monster Hunter: World Board Game Inventory
An app that keeps track of your inventory while playing the [Monster Hunter World board game](https://steamforged.com/products/monster-hunter-world-the-board-game) made by [Steamforged Games](https://steamforged.com/).

The idea of the app is to represent the paper that contains your materials and items and such. I wanted to keep this info on my phone and it gave me something to practice Android Compose on.

## Note
Still a work in progress.
